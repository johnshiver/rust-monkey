## Rust Monkey

Implementation of Monkey language as described in Thorsten Ball's book: https://interpreterbook.com

After implementing the lexer I found other implementation of the monkey language in Rust, notably Paul Dix's implentation: https://github.com/pauldix/monkey-rust, from which I have borrowed heavily.
